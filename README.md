# Are u Searching Previous WWDC?

## What's this

**This is an app try to help u find more wwdc sessions than the offical Develper app.


## Why build this

I'm a new hand in iOS develope, on the road of learning, i find there're a bounch of things to understand, I tried to read apple's document. but most of the time, they are not in detail.
Except of tutorials by third-party on the web, i think WWDC Sessions are pretty good for learning. However, in [the Developer app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/all-videos/) which is offered by apple only contains the sessions in recent year, when i dive in specific subject, the sessions on app are not enough.Even [the unoffical WWDC app](https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC) in Github has the same problem. 


## Where the data from

I found [a project in Github that offer a list](https://github.com/youjinp/wwdc-list) of previous WWDC, in the markdown file, u can find more WWDC session's url. However it's not convenient to open that file, especially on the mobile device, so i use the list, and try to make an simple app to show them


## How to use
Download the source code and build on your device.
In this moment, the app is not ready to use friently,maybe version 0.1. And i'll try to update it, and hope u can join me.
